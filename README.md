Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a powerful class of neural networks that are used for an unsupervised learning. GANs are made up of two neural networks, a - discriminator and a generator. They use adversarial training to produce artificial data that is identical to actual data.

- The Generator attempts to fool the Discriminator, which is tasked with accurately distinguishing between produced and genuine data, by producing random noise samples.
- Realistic, high-quality samples are produced as a result of this competitive interaction, which drives both networks toward advancement.
- GANs are proving to be highly versatile artificial intelligence tools, as evidenced by their extensive use in image synthesis, style transfer, and text-to-image synthesis.
